# PlatformShootSkills (Working Title)

So I had this idea of making a platformer like game which takes place in a Retro Wave enviroment. It was a very shallow idea so i decided to just start making it and see where it got me from there. I mainly started this project to improve my Unity and C# skills.

Here I want to show a few things that this project contains.

# 1. The Character movement.
So for the character movement I used Ethan from the standard assets. Ethan also includes 2 scripts: "ThirdPersonUserControl" and "ThirdPersonCharacter". The ThirdPersonCharacter scripts included the physics and controlling the animator. I always like to have seperate scripts for seperate purposes so I decided to take the scripts apart and make 3 seperate scripts: "PlayerAnimationController", "PlayerMotor" and "PlayerController".
